# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

#The R script called run_analysis.R does the following: 

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  #the name of the data set produced by this part of the script is "selected_df"
  
#From the data set in the previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  #the name of the data set of means of variables indexed by subject and activity
  #is called "merged_means"
